## Description
this application is designed to take the users input as the date of birth (yyyy/mm/dd)
the app then calculates the day of the week they were born and give the feedback on the actual days of birth corresponding with the Akan name as listed in the table.

## Key words
On calculation of the day, the formulae used is ;
dw=(((cc/4)-2*cc-1)+((5*yy/4)+((26*(mm+1)/10))+dd)% 7

keyword;
dw- the day of the week.
cc-century number (1995 where 19 is the century number)
yy-the year (1995 where 95 is the year)
mm-this is the month.
Dd-this the date of the month.
% - this it the modulus



## Known Bugs
though the app is running ,at times it might not give the actual day of birth due to the leap year concept that has not been considered while doing the calculations. Thus this will need an upgrade in future for actual birth days

## Technologies Used
Basically the app is build on the HTML and CSS languages that have been enhanced by the use of bootstrap styling that makes the page more responsive and user friendly.

## Support and contact details
the app is not well finished and will require more styling and additional code to finish it up to produce the results as expected,thus any help on making the app more convenient and additional ideas are welcome. Please fill free to contact me on ;
